# Building an API with Express/Prisma

## Agenda

- Why learning to build an API


## Why learning to build an API

- **Enables Integration and Scalability**: create applications that can easily integrate with other services and scale efficiently. It can be used on multiple platforms (website, mobile apps, etc.).

- **Facilitates Modern Architectures and Technologies**:  Allows for more modular and distributed app architecture, aligning with current trends in software development. 

- **Improves Collaboration and Project Versatility**: APIs enable collaboration between developers, teams, and organizations by allowing for modular development where different teams can work on separate components simultaneously.

## Building a simple Movie API

- We're going to build an API to demonstrate:

  - How to setup and organize the backend effectively
  - Integrate Prisma into our stack to simplify working with databases


## What is Prisma

Prisma is a modern Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies database access and manipulation in web applications.

1. Add an abstraction layer allowing you to interact with the databases inside your app using JavaScript with an object-oriented approach. You work with database entities as if they were JavaScript objects.

2. Abstract the database the app is using. An ORM tools abstract the underlying database system, making it possible to work with various databases

3. Provides convenient tools to help manage your database such as the schema, migrations, high-level queries, and a visual database browser
